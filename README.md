Here are few interesting problems that you would love to solve! :bulb:
Happy Coding! :tada:

### *HOW TO?*
1. First clone the repository in your local machine
2. Pick any problem, solve it in any programming language that you want. For every problem there are respective directories present in the repository. In a particular problem's directory you can find files with different file extensions (for now `.java`, `.cpp`, `.c`, `.py`). If you solved it using any other language then just create the filename in the same manner following the extension of the file. 
	> For Eg. problem_7.js
3. When you are done with solving the problems then its time to commit your changes push to your forked repository and make a pull request.
4. Congrats you have done well !!! :tada:

### *RULES:*
1. Problems can be solved in any programming language *python*, *cpp*, *java*, *c*, etc. or any other of your choice
2. Copied solution would not be merged and could leads to disqualification.
3. Participants are not required to add **code stubs** in the solution files and try to keep your solution as reduced as possible
4. Ready! Set! Go! :rocket:
